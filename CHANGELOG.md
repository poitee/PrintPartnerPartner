# Changelog

All notable changes to Print Partner are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Build plan management** — create, rename, duplicate, and delete plans from the Build tab (restores `PlanManager` wiring lost during the web migration).
- **Branding** — project logo (`docs/logo.png`) on the README and GitHub Pages landing page; Ko-fi support badge near the top of both.

## [3.0.0-web] - 2026-05-31

Print Partner is now a **single web platform**. The **Sources → Build → Review → Checkoff** workflow moves to a TypeScript monorepo under `web/`: a Vite + React single-page app (`web/apps/web`) and a Fastify API (`web/apps/server`) served together on one port, with shared `contracts` and `domain` packages.

### Added

- **Docker self-host** — `docker compose up --build` serves the API + SPA on port 8080; data persists in the `print-partner-data` volume at `/data` (SQLite, synced repos, exports, thumbnails). Config via `PRINT_PARTNER_DATA_DIR`, `HOST`, `PORT`, `STATIC_DIR`, `DEPLOY_MODE`, `CORS_ORIGIN`/`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `BASIC_AUTH_USER`/`PASS`, `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`, `PP_VERSION`.
- **SaaS mode** (`DEPLOY_MODE=saas`) — multi-tenant hosting with Postgres app data (`DATABASE_URL`), S3-compatible blob storage (`S3_BUCKET`), GitHub OAuth, and an optional Redis/BullMQ job queue. Ready-to-run `docker-compose.saas.yml` stack (Postgres 16 + MinIO).
- **Ports/adapters architecture** — `self-host` (SQLite + local disk) and `saas` (Postgres + S3) adapters behind shared ports; Drizzle ORM with SQLite or Postgres; client-side Three.js STL rendering; background job runner with `/ws/jobs/:id` progress.
- **Desktop-data migration** — import an existing `~/.print-partner` SQLite DB and repos into the web data dir (see `web/DEPLOY.md`).

### Removed

- **Legacy desktop app** — the Python/PySide6 + Tauri desktop code, PyInstaller packaging, and desktop-only CI/docs are removed; the web platform is the canonical codebase.

### Changed

- **Documentation** — root `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the GitHub Pages landing page (`docs/index.html`) rewritten for the web platform, with regenerated workflow screenshots.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-31

Major release: Tauri + React desktop replaces the legacy Qt UI. Workflow is **Sources → Build → Review → Checkoff** with a quantity-aware STL exporter instead of in-app bed planning.

### Added

- **Tauri + React desktop** — primary shell with sidebar workflow, command palette (⌘K), job tray, and plan picker.
- **Build** — attach sources, pick STLs, set quantities; **role filament colors** (primary/accent/clear/opaque) with bulk apply and tinted 3D previews; **Docs** button on source cards to read synced repo READMEs.
- **Review** — editable parts list (add/remove/change quantities); validation summary; **Export STLs** by role and folder with quantity copies.
- **Checkoff** — per-unit print progress (persisted); filter missing/done; **Export missing STLs** into a rebuilt `stl-missing/` folder; checklist HTML export.
- **STL export layout** — `~/.print-partner/exports/{plan}/stl/{role}/{folder}/` and `stl-missing/` for outstanding parts only.
- **Sources** — user-managed categories, grid/list view, global STL search, remote update-check badges.
- **Settings** — configurable STL naming rules and source update interval.
- **Open data folder** — sidebar footer, Settings, and Help links to `~/.print-partner`.
- **Share build** — config-only `.print-partner-kit.zip` (no STLs); import via ⌘K.
- **License** — [Print Partner Non-Commercial Software License](LICENSE) (Annex-inspired; commercial print-farm internal use permitted); see [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md).

### Removed

- **Legacy Qt UI** — entire `print_partner.ui` tree and PySide6 dependency.
- **Plate page and printer fleet UI** — bed assignment and 3MF plate planning removed from the desktop shell; export focuses on organized STL folders.

### Changed

- **CI/release** — engine bundles + Tauri matrix on Linux/macOS/Windows.
- **README & docs** — refreshed screenshots and workflow documentation for the four-step flow.

### Fixed

- **Recompute crash** — `compare_geometry` name shadowing in merge layers.
- **Checkoff toggles** — duplicate `print_progress` rows deduped (schema v9); stack reconcile for unit marking.
- **Export paths** — fresh `stl/` and `stl-missing/` directories on each export run.

[2.0.0]: https://github.com/poitee/PrintPartnerPartner/compare/v0.3.1...v2.0.0

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **React Build — quantity override** — per-part stepper/input with auto vs override labels; `PATCH /parts/{id}` wired in UI.
- **React Build — STL preview panel** — click a part row to show a larger cached preview via `GET /parts/{id}/preview`.
- **Community manifest browser** — `GET /manifest-registry` lists approved entries; read-only list in Help.
- **Desktop CI** — `.github/workflows/desktop.yml` runs pytest, builds the engine on Ubuntu + macOS, and optionally runs the Vite desktop shell build on macOS.
- **Release workflow** — `release.yml` attaches Qt archives plus `print-partner-engine` Linux/macOS tarballs; optional macOS Tauri bundle (`continue-on-error`). Manual per-OS Tauri builds: [`docs/RELEASE_DESKTOP.md`](docs/RELEASE_DESKTOP.md).
- **Desktop verify script** — `packaging/verify_desktop_build.sh` checks engine binary, optional Tauri bundle, and `/health` for 5s.

### Changed

- **Version** — `1.0.0` GA for Tauri-first desktop (~80% Qt parity); beta workflow blockers cleared.
- **Part list API** — profile parts include `quantity_auto` and `quantity_override`.
- **Libraries (React)** — **Browse registry** links to community manifests on GitHub.

### Notes

- Full **`npm run tauri build`** on Windows/Linux remains a **manual release step**; macOS may succeed in CI but is not required. See [`docs/RELEASE_DESKTOP.md`](docs/RELEASE_DESKTOP.md) and [`docs/RELEASE_1.0.0_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/RELEASE_1.0.0_CHECKLIST.md).

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Tauri desktop as default CLI** — `print-partner` launches the built Tauri app when `dist/Print Partner.app` (macOS) or `dist/print-partner-desktop` exists; falls back to Qt with a deprecation warning. Dev helper: `scripts/launch_desktop.sh`.
- **Engine APIs** — `GET /filaments/catalog` (Ambrosia + custom colors), `GET /help/workflow` (markdown workflow guide). OpenAPI at `/openapi.json`.
- **React Build** — per-part filament picker (catalog + custom colors from Settings).
- **React Print** — assignment summary table by printer; improved printer dropdown with enabled/other groups.
- **React Help** — workflow guide loaded from engine; OpenAPI URL shown in Help.
- **OpenAPI client script** — `apps/desktop/scripts/generate-api-client.sh`.
- **Legacy Qt docs** — [`docs/LEGACY_QT.md`](docs/LEGACY_QT.md) for `PRINT_PARTNER_USE_QT=1`.

### Changed

- **Version** — `1.0.0-beta.1` toward v1.0 Tauri cutover (~78% Qt parity).
- **Desktop dev docs** — launcher behavior, catalog/help endpoints, OpenAPI workflow in [`DESKTOP_DEV.md`](docs/DESKTOP_DEV.md).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Kit manifest system** — `print-partner.manifest.yaml` at repo root; load/validate/apply in core; **Kit → Manage → Manifest…** editor with option groups, drift warnings after recompute, and **Generate manifest draft** from README + scan.
- **Community manifest registry** — `manifests/` in this repo with PR template, `registry/index.yaml`, and **Import community manifest…** in the app.
- **Performance** — mesh load cache in export pipeline; per-project scan cache keyed by commit SHA; parallel remote update checks; **Help → Fast recompute** (skip geometry compare on Recompute).
- **Parts tree virtualization** — `QTreeView` + `QAbstractItemModel` for large kits (5k+ rows); collapse-all when >500 parts with summary hint.
- **ProfileComposer mixins** — `export_actions.py` and `checkoff_actions.py` extracted from the composer hub.

### Changed

- **License docs** — [PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0](LICENSE) with [LICENSE-SUMMARY.md](LICENSE-SUMMARY.md) and [COMMERCIAL.md](COMMERCIAL.md); Help menu entries for overview and full license text.

- **Checkoff print tracking** — Per-unit printed counts save to the kit; filter all/missing/done; **Print missing →** loads unfinished units on the Print tab; **Export missing 3MF…** for slicer plates; in-tab guide for exports.

### Changed

- **Libraries / Kit / Print / Checkoff UI** — Clearer step guides, tooltips, wider readable columns, simplified part filters, tighter checkoff layout, and checkoff export help copy.
- **License & notices** — Non-commercial license, third-party notices, in-app Help entries, bundled in release builds.

### Fixed
